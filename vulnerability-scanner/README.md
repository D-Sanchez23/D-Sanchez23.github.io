# Vulnerability Scanner

A Python project that scans websites for various vulnerabilities, including HTTP header checks, port scanning, and SSL security checks.

## Features

- **HTTP Header Check**: Checks for the presence of important security headers (e.g., X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options).
- **Port Scanner**: Scans ports 1 through 1024 to check if they are open.
- **SSL Security Check**: Checks if the SSL certificate of a website is valid and provides its expiration date.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/D-Sanchez23/vulnerability-scanner.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd vulnerability-scanner

## Usage

1. To run the vulnerability scanner, execute the following command in your terminal, replacing <url> with the target website:
   ```bash
   python vulnerability-scanner.py <url>
2. The scanner will then output the following: 
 
- HTTP Header Check:
       The scanner will output the status of important security headers for the provided URL.
- Port Scanning:
       The scanner will list open ports from 1 to 1023.
- SSL Security Check:
       The scanner will validate the SSL certificate and show its expiration date.
## Input
   - URL: Provide the URL when prompted by the scanner.

## Running the Vulnerability Scanner

   1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
   2. Run the scanner using the command line or terminal as described above.
   3. Review the output for the security header status, open ports, and SSL information.
