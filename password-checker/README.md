# Password Strength Checker

## Overview

This project is a Python-based password strength checker that evaluates the security of user-supplied passwords. It also compares passwords against known breaches to alert users if their password has been compromised. The goal is to help users create stronger, more secure passwords by providing real-time feedback.

## Features

- **Password Strength Evaluation**: Analyzes the strength of a password based on length, character variety, and common patterns.
- **Breach Detection**: Checks if the password has been found in any public data breaches.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides suggestions to strengthen weak passwords.

## How It Works

The password checker analyzes the following criteria:
- **Length**: Minimum of 8 characters is recommended.
- **Character Variety**: Evaluates the use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Common Password Patterns**: Identifies if the password uses commonly known weak patterns like "123456" or "password."
- **Breach Comparison**: Uses an API or dataset to compare the password against known breaches.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git

3. **Install Dependencies**:

    Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed. Install any required dependencies by running:
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Password Checker**:

     Once the repository is cloned and dependencies are installed, you can run the password checker as follows:

     ```bash
     python password-checker.py

4. **Input a Password**:

    After running the program, you will be prompted to input a password for analysis. The tool will evaluate the password strength based on the following criteria:

    - Length: The password length is a key factor in strength.
    - Character Variety: The tool checks for the inclusion of:
    - Uppercase letters
    - Lowercase letters
    - Numbers
    - Special characters (e.g., @, #, $, etc.)
  
    The password will also be checked against a database of compromised passwords. If the password has been found in known breaches, it will be flagged as unsafe.

5. **View Results**:

     The program will display the strength score of the password, along with recommendations to improve it if necessary.

     ```bash
     Password Strength: Weak
     Recommendations: Add more characters, use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.

6. **Exit**:

     To exit the program press Ctrl+C or allow the program to finish its analysis and terminate.
