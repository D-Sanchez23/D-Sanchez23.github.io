        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Dante Sanchez, and welcome to my portfolio! Before diving into more about me, I want to share my reasoning and thought process behind creating this space. I believe that college degrees don’t always equate to good employees—and no, I'm not saying that just because I don’t currently have one. In fact, a recent Federal Reserve survey found that 40% of college graduates are dissatisfied with their chosen major. That’s almost half of future professionals who might not feel fulfilled in their field. While a degree may demonstrate knowledge, I think true success often stems from two essential qualities: passion and motivation.</p>
        <p>This portfolio serves as evidence of both my commitment and my enthusiasm for building a career in IT security. I’m dedicated to enhancing and progressing my skills independently, showcasing a willingness to learn and grow. I also understand that saying, “Trust me, I know what I’m talking about,” isn't enough. This portfolio allows me to provide tangible proof of my knowledge in IT security and coding, and it is by no means a finished product—I will be continuously updating it as my skills and experiences grow.</p>
        <p>As for my background, I'm a motivated IT enthusiast with a focus on cybersecurity and Python development. Through certifications like Blue Team Level 1 and Certified in Cybersecurity (ISC2), I’ve established a strong foundation in security principles. Platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox, along with personal projects like developing a vulnerability scanner, have been invaluable in advancing my hands-on skills. I’m actively working to deepen my expertise in Python and cybersecurity tools with the goal of transitioning into a professional role in IT security. Outside of tech, I enjoy strategy-based games that keep me engaged and challenge my critical thinking, working out to stay active, and spending quality time with my two cats.</p>
